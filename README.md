# Workday Scheduler 

## Overview
* A user can see the current date at the top of the page, with live updating.
* A user sees a list with time blocks divided by hour, with spaces to add memos/details for that hour block. 
* On the righthand side, there are two functional buttons. 
  **'Save' adds the user's text inputs to local storage, so that data remains on page refresh.
  ** 'Clear' removes all text from view/the local storage.
