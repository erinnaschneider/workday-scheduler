# Workday Scheduler 
A daily planner for scheduling out your workday's core hours.

## Overview
* A user can see the current date at the top of the page, with live updating.
* A user sees a list with time blocks divided by hour, with spaces to add memos/details for that hour block. 
* On the righthand side, there are two functional buttons. 
  * 'Save' adds the user's text inputs to local storage, so that data remains on page refresh.
  * 'Clear' removes all text from view/the local storage.
* If the time block is before the current time displayed, that time block is greyed out.
* If the time block is during the current time displayed, that time block is made red.
* If the time block is after the current time displayed, that time block is made green.
